# Actions due to railway traffic on bridges.
Imposed loads (models and representative values) associated with rail traffic which include dynamic effects and centrifugal, braking and acceleration actions and actions for accidental design situations.

### Dynamic load factors.
Dynamic load factors (Ï•) relate the magnitude of vertical wheel-to-rail loads in operation (dynamic loads) to static loads resulting from the weight of the vehicle and its contents, as a function of train speed.

### Classification factor
Load factor used normally to introduce future variations in the loads introduced by the trains.

### Slipstream
A slipstream is a region behind a moving object in which a wake of fluid (typically air or water) is moving at velocities comparable to that of the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving.
