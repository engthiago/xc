# Traffic loads verification tests

## Railway traffic loads

### Dynamic load factors.
Dynamic load factors (Ï•) relate the magnitude of vertical wheel-to-rail loads in operation (dynamic loads) to static loads resulting from the weight of the vehicle and its contents, as a function of train speed.

### Classification factor
Load factor used normally to introduce future variations in the loads introduced by the trains.

### Slipstream
A slipstream is a region behind a moving object in which a wake of fluid (typically air or water) is moving at velocities comparable to that of the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving.
