// DOF_Graph is a graph of the DOFs in the analysis model. It is used

//! DOFGraph is a type of Graph. It is a graph of the DOF
//! connectivity of the analysis model. It is utilised by a SystemOfEqn
//! object to determine the sparsity of the system. It is a subtype of
//! ArrayGraph, though it could just as easily be a subtype of any other
//! type of Graph subclass that fully implements the graph interface.
