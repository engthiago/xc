# Load combinations
A load combination results when more than one load type acts on the structure. Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each load type in order to ensure the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios.

The tests in this folder are intended to check the automatic generation of load combinations implemented in the [loadCombinations](https://github.com/xcfem/xc/tree/master/src/utility/loadCombinations) and module of XC and the Python utilities in [load_combination_utils](https://github.com/xcfem/xc/tree/master/python_modules/actions/load_combination_utils).
