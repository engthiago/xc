// Description: This file contains the class definition for DiagonalSolver.
// DiagonalSolver is an abstract base class and thus no objects of it's type
// can be instantiated. It has pure virtual functions which must be
// implemented in it's derived classes.  Instances of DiagonalSolver 
// are used to solve a system of equations of type DiagonalSOE.
//
// What: "@(#) DiagonalSolver.h, revA"
