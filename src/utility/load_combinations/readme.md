# Load combinations
A load combination results when more than one load type acts on the structure. Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each load type in order to ensure the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios.

The aim of the code in this folders is to implement an algorithm that generates the load combinations from a set of actions automatically.

## Implementation of load groups: PENDING
Some strucural codes define load groups formed by actions that share the partial safety factors when combined but have different combination factors. See section 3.9.3.1 in document [Bridge Design to Eurocodes Worked examples](https://eurocodes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Bridge_Design-Eurocodes-Worked_examples.pdf) page 62.
