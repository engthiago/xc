// Description: This file contains the class definition for BandGenLinSolver.
// BandGenLinSolver is an abstract base class and thus no objects of it's type
// can be instantiated. It has pure virtual functions which must be
// implemented in it's derived classes.  Instances of BandGenLinSolver 
// are used to solve a system of equations of type BandGenLinSOE.
//
// What: "@(#) BandGenLinSolver.h, revA"
