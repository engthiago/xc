// ProfileSPDLinDirectThreadSolver. ProfileSPDLinDirectThreadSolver is a subclass 
// of LinearSOESOlver. It solves a ProfileSPDLinSOE object using
// the LDL^t factorization.

//! @brief solves a ProfileSPDLinSOE object using
//! the LDL^t factorization (threaded version).
//!
//! A ProfileSPDLinDirectThreadSolver object can be constructed to
//! solve a ProfileSPDLinSOE object. It does this in parallel using
//! threads by direct means, using the \f$LDL^t\f$ variation of the cholesky
//! factorization. The matrx \f$A\f$ is factored one row block at a time using
//! a left-looking approach. Within a row block the factorization is
//! performed by \f$NP\f$ threads. No BLAS or LAPACK routines are called 
//! for the factorization or subsequent substitution.
