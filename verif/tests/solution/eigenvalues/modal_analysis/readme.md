# Modal analysis

Modal analysis is the study of the dynamic properties of systems in the frequency domain. In structural engineering, modal analysis uses the overall mass and stiffness of a structure to find the various periods at which it will naturally resonate.

This folder contains the verification examples used the accuracy of such analysis in XC.
