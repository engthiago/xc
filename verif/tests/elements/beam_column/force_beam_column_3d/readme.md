# Force-based beam-column 3D element verification tests

The tests `test_force_beam_column_3d_` 01 to 09 are parallel to the tests `cantilever3d_` 01 to 09 in the [elastic_beam_3d](https://github.com/xcfem/xc/tree/master/verif/tests/elements/beam_column/elastic_beam_3d) folder. The remaining tests (10 to 13) are not written yet.
