// GraphPartitioner is an abstract base class. Its subtypes are responsible for

// partition which sets the colors of the vertices of the graph to colors 1

    //! a color \f$1\f$ through \p numPart, the color assigned indicating the

    //! negative number if not; the value depending on the subclass.
