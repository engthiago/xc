# Serviceability limit states

In civil engineering and structural engineering, serviceability refers to the conditions under which a building is still considered useful. Should these limit states be exceeded, a structure that may still be structurally sound would nevertheless be considered unfit. It refers to conditions other than the building strength that render the buildings unusable. Serviceability limit state design of structures includes factors such as durability, overall stability, fire resistance, deflection, cracking and excessive vibration.

This module contains routines that make easier to check the compliance of the
structure with respect to the Serviceability Limit States.
