// Description: This file contains the class definition for ArrayGraph.
// The vertices in an ArrayGraph are held in an array. This is more efficient
// than holding them in a List data structure, but problems can arise with
// large Graphs in getting enough contiguous memory for the array.
//
// What: "@(#) ArrayGraph.h, revA"

//
//! @brief Graph that uses an array to store its vertices.
//!
//! ArrayGraph is a subtype of Graph. The vertices for this type
//! of graph are held in a simple array data structure whose initial size
//! is specified at construction. This size can increase if
//! needed. The array storage scheme is more efficient than a List storage
//! scheme in terms of accessing the vertices; in very large problems
//! where memory is limited this type of scheme may have problems getting
//! enough contiguous meory in which case a List might be a better
//! choice. {\bf There is a question as to whether or not the public
//! methods should be declared as virtual. Good OOP programming would have
//! all methods declared as virtual, however as subclasses cannot gain
//! access to the private member data there does not seem to be much point
//! in declaring them, except for the destructor, virtual in this
//! instance.}
