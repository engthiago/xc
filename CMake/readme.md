# CMake helpers

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to control the XC compilation process. This directory contains some files that help CMake find the required packages that are not already part of the CMake modules (take a look at the find modules [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-modules.7.html)).
