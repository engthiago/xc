# Find the MySQL client includes and library
# 

# This module defines
# MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, where to find mysql.h
# MYSQL_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to connect to MySQL
# MYSQL_FOUND, If false, you cannot build anything that requires MySQL.

# also defined, but not for general use are
# MYSQL_LIBRARY, where to find the MySQL library.

# 
# XXX NOTE: This is not yet for general use.  I'm pretty sure there
# are other libraries I have to link against at the same time.
