# Ill-conditioning in structural finite element models

Finite element models can contain errors that can lead to a class of ill-conditioned stiffness matrices. The extremal eigenpairs of such matrices can be used to identify causes of ill-conditioning.

The verification tests in this folder check the current ill-conditioning detection algorithms in XC.
