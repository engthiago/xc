# Time series
Time series objects are used in XC to describe time variation
of earthquake ground motions or nodal loads. This is made by changing
determine the load factor to be applied to the loads in a pattern.

This directory contains the different types of times series available:

- Constant time series.
- Linear time series.
- Trigonometric time series.
- Triangular time series.
- Rectangular time series.
- Pulse time series.
- Path time series.
- Discretized random process series.
- Simulated random process series.
