# Plane elements (quads, shells, etc.)

Two dimensional elements to be used in 2D (plane strain or plane stress problems) and 3D problems (shells).

## Contents

		- fourNodeQuad: four node quad elements.
		- LST39template: plane stress triangle with drilling DOF's.
		- shell: shell elements.
		- triangle: triangular elements
		- UP-ucsd: four-node plane-strain element implemented for simulating dynamic response of solid-fluid fully coupled material.
