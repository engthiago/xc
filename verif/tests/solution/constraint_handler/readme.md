# Constraint handler tests

The ConstraintHandler object determines how the constraint equations are enforced in the analysis. Constraint equations enforce a specified value for a DOF, or a relationship between DOFs. There are four types of constraint handlers:

- Plain Constraints
- Lagrange Multipliers
- Penalty Method
- Transformation Method
