# Load combinations
A load combination results when more than one load type acts on the structure. Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each load type in order to ensure the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios.

The tests in this folder are intended to check the results obtained when adding
to the model load combinations instead of individual load patterns.
