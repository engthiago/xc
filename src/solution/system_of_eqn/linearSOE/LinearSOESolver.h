// Description: This file contains the class definition for LinearSOESolver.
// LinearSOESolver is an abstract base class and thus no objects of it's type
// can be instantiated. It has pure virtual functions which must be
// implemented in it's derived classes.  Instances of LinearSOESolver are used
// to solve a system of equations.
