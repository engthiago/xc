# Single freedom constraints

A single freedom constraint specifies the response of a particular degree-of-freedom at a node. This type of constraints are used to represent:

- Support points (zero displacement along one or more degrees of freedom).
- Support settlement (nonzero displacement along one or more degrees of freedom).
- Imposed motions (displacement varying with time along one or more degrees of freedom).
