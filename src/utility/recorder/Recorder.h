//! @brief An Recorder object is used in the program to
//! store/restore information at each commit().
//!
//! The Recorder class is an abstract class which is introduced to allow
//! information to be saved during the analysis. The interface defines two
//! pure virtual methods record()} and {\em playback(). {\em
//! record()} is a method which is called by the Domain object during a
//! commit()}. The {\em playback() method can be called by the analyst after
//! the analysis has been performed.
